There can be duplicates in the output if they are in the top 3. It is not the case that a pair of teams must only appear once. If the same team has multiple matches against a team with the same number of sixes in top 3, then you can return the same row multiple times. So, in short, if they're different matches, they can be simultaneously in the output, so you don't have to handle the duplicates.
