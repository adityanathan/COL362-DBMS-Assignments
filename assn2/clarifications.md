# Flights

## Creation
- Are there any foreign keys in the database?
- integer = bigint?

## Queries
- For albuquerque, use id or join with airports and use name?

- 5,6
  - Is the length = no. of cities or no.edges = no. of cities - 1?
  - For 4, does albuquerque necessarily have to be at the start and end or can it just be in the middle? I don't see causing a change in ans though.

- When we are asked to do comething with Alb, do we use the city name or the airport id?

- union vs unionall. I'm using union because paths are anyways distinct. I'm hoping this is fine?

- Can we use the given city names as strings?
